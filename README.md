LLMOps platforms can deliver more efficient library management, lowering operational costs and enabling less technical personnel to complete tasks. These operations include data preprocessing, language model training, monitoring, fine-tuning and deployment. As with Machine Learning Ops (MLOps), LLMOps is built on a collaboration of data scientists, DevOps engineers and IT professionals. 

LLMs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT using GPT-4 and Google's BERT represent a new and more advanced class of 
natural language processing (NLP) models that can quickly answer natural-language questions, provide summarization and follow complex instructions. 

An LLMOps platform brings data science and software engineering into a collaborative environment for data exploration, real-time experiment tracking, prompt engineering, plus model and pipeline management. LLMOps automates the operational and monitoring tasks in the machine learning lifecycle.
